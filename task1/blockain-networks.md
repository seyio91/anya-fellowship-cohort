# Types of Blockchain Network

## Public Blockchain
Public Blockchain network is accessible to the public without any limitations of validation and participants. As it does not have any central authority an individual is unable to manipulate the network tha stores unchangeable data. 
The combination of economic incentives with cryptographic verification using procedures such as proof-of-work (Bitcoin) or proof-of-stake (Ethereum) â€” secures public blockchains (Ethereum). These blockchains are regarded as "completely decentralized" in general. 
However, significant computing power is required, there is little or no privacy for transactions, and security is inadequate.

## Private blockchains
Private blockchains, also known as managed blockchains, are permissioned blockchains that are administered by a single entity. The central authority in a private blockchain decides who can be a node. 
In addition, the central authority does not always grant each node identical rights to execute functions. However, because public access to private blockchains is restricted, they are only partially decentralized. These blockchain provide higher level of privacy as well as speed, as a large number of nodes do not need to perform transaction verification.

## Consortium blockchain network
Consortium blockchains, unlike private blockchains, are permissioned blockchains administered by a consortium of organizations rather than a single institution. As a result, consortium blockchains have more decentralization than private blockchains, resulting in increased security. The consensus process is controlled by a pre-selected set of nodes, for example, a consortium of 15 financial institutions, each of which operates a node and of which 10 must sign every block in order for the block to be valid. The right to read the blockchain may be or restricted to the participants. Consortium blockchains are also referred to as federated blockchains.

## Hybrid Blockchain Networks
A hybrid blockchain is a type of blockchain technology that combines components of both public and private blockchain to get the ideal part of both public and private blockchain solutions.
Transactions and records in a hybrid blockchain are made private but can be verified when entailed, such as by enabling access through a smart contract. Private information is kept inside the network but is still verifiable.
Although a private entity may own the hybrid blockchain, it cannot change transactions. A hybrid blockchain allows organisations to establish a private, permission-based system beside a public permissionless system, enabling them to administer who can access particular data strored in the blockchain, and which data will be made public.
