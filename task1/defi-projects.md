1. Chainlink

Chainlink (LINK) is a decentralized oracle service that aims to connect smart contracts with data from the real world using oracle technology. Connecting external data allows a contract to have the information from real-world external events, APIs, and other blockchains. Chainlink recently announced the launch of a Programmable Token Bridge that will allow for new communication between DeFi blockchains. This will help DeFi to properly scale and avoid the bottlenecks holding back the earlier generations of blockchain projects.

2. Polkadot

Polkadot (DOT) facilitates connection of blockchain networks into a unified network where independent blockchains can exchange information and transactions in a trustless way via the Polkadot relay chain. 
The main blockchain (relay chain) is where transactions are finalized. To achieve a greater speed, the relay chain separates the addition of new transactions from the act of validating those transactions.
Connected Chains in the Polkadot network is known as Parachains, and they use relay chains computing resources to validate transactions. This makes Polkadot, and projects who choose to build on Polkadot, much faster and scalable than Ethereum’s current offering. By acting as a foundation for DeFi projects to build upon, it’s aiding the growth and potential of the network as a whole.

3. Terra Luna

Terra Luna (LUNA) is a next-generation smart contract platform that combines decentralized finance with the concept of stablecoins. Its platform supports stablecoins that offer instant settlements, low fees, and seamless cross-border exchange. Luna functions as the volatile backbone that keeps Terra, its stablecoin sibling, balanced and grounded. Adding the emerging popularity of DeFi to the serious attention stablecoins are getting — from consumers and governments alike —makes LUNA one to watch.

4. Polygon

Polygon is a decentralised Ethereum scaling platform that runs alongside the Ethereum blockchain — allowing for speedy transactions and low fees. It boasts features such as interoperability, scalability and security. Basically, Polygon adds a few traffic lanes to the heavily traveled Ethereum Layer 1 highway. The majority of DeFi projects are currently housed on the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, less congestion on Ethereum means faster speeds and more benefits for the DeFi ecosystem.

5. Avalanche

Avalanche (AVAX) markets themselves as “the fastest smart contracts platform in the blockchain industry,” while also solidifying their place in the booming NFT space and building connectivity with other blockchain projects such as SushiSwap (SUSHI), Chainlink (LINK), and the Graph (GRT). The project positions itself as a direct rival to Ethereum due to its ability to provide cheaper transactions in a fraction of the time. Avalanche recently completed $230 million in funding to support its DeFi initiatives, making it a compelling place for DeFi projects to set up shop.
